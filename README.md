# Awesome Window Manager Configuration

This repository is a subdirectory of my larger [dotfiles](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles) repo, which houses my configurations and scripts that are useful to my in administering and customizing my Linux Installations.

> > Note as Refactor is in Progress. Check back in soon, big things are coming this way.

### Refactoring

- Goals:
  - Adding in desired functionality of the elenapan configuration with the order and clever heuristics already in place in the prior configuration.
  - Adding in other functionality from othwer configurations where it would be helpful, integrating it into the prior configuration.
  - Better organization of the modular portions of the configuration
  - Refactoring dependencies to use `_M` more efficiently
  - Linting the parts of the config that are suboptimal or ineffective
  - making keybindings more consistent with i3 configuration
  - further integration of Vice color scheme vis-a-vis my .Xresources.d/color colors
