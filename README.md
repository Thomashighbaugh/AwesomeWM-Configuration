# Awesome Configuration 

This repository houses my heavily customized AwesomeWM configuration. This configuration has been the result of my blending of some of the ideas and functionality I liked in various `popular` configurations, like the [Glorious Dotfiles] and [elenapan's configuration] to name a few, while expanding into its own direction entirely. 

## Directory Structure

No subdirectories name noodle here, I have tried to keep the names as informative and functional as possible, nonetheless I have decided to provide you with this key just to reduce ambiguity as much as possible.
