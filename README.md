# Awesome Window Manager Configuration

This is the repository housing the configuration for Awesome Window Manager that
I have cobbled together for my personal use. As such it forms the basis of the
AwesomeWM configuration of the Electric Tantra Linux project, which exists
primarily to ease the process of testing out this configuration without needing
to readjust scores of variables on your workstation to appreciate this
environment in much the same way as yours truly.
