# Awesome Window Manager

This is a part of my general [dotfiles](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles) that provide the consistent (in some sense) environment that I use across the various Linux systems I use.

This configures the window manager, which is the software drawing windows on the screen and thus one I interact with a lot. As such, I have spent a lot of time getting it to work `just right` for my use cases, while insuring it was as aesthetically pleasing (to me at least) as possible. 


## Dependencies 
Intergral within this configuration are several additional programs one must install in addition to the development branch of AwesomeWM (which is `awesome-git` on the `Arch User Repository`) which I listed below so in case you decided to try to use this configuration, you would be able to appreciate it as it is intended for these programs are vital to the workflow I expect one would fall into using this monstriousity.

- `rofi-git` - development branch of rofi the dmenu replacement

## Wallpapers
All of the wallpapers included are my own work, available in the `/images/` subdirectory and offered under a different license than the rest of what is in this repository. When it comes to the artwork, all rights are reserved to the creator (me, Thomas Leon Highbaugh) and express permission is required for any distribution of these artworks other than your own private usage following your acquistion of the work from this repository. The rest of the repository is offered under the MIT license (or relevant licenses in the cases of the subdirectories found in `/external/lib`).

Most of the artwork is, or began as, pictures of San Francisco that I have taken and modified using a host of different methods until it reached the form in which it is presented to you, generally involving GIMP and the GMIC extension such that there is _usually_ an inflection of the `tech noir` style in it.
