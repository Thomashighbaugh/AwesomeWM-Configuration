## 0.3. :rocket: Technologies ##

The following tools were used in this project:

- [Awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/)
- [Lua](https://luarocks.org/)
- [Patience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva)
- [UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)

## 0.4. :white_check_mark: Requirements ##

This project requires you to have the variant of AwesomeWM built from the development branch, which if you have an Arch-based system and yay installed is acquired with the following command, which includes other necessary programs for running the setup:

```bash
yay -S awesome-git 
``` 
All of which is included in my [dotfiles installation script](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles)
ctivatable.h:25,
                 from /usr/include/libpeas-1.0/libpeas/peas.h:23,
                 from is-libsensors-plugin.h:21,
                 from is-libsensors-plugin.c:22:ctivatable.h:25,
                 from /usr/include/libpeas-1.0/libpeas/peas.h:23,
                 from is-libsensors-plugin.h:21,
                 from is-libsensors-plugin.c:22:

Users of other distros will have to build from the source (sorry), follow the instructions on Awesome's README page for detailed instructions 


**Coming Soon** You can preview this whole set up without needing to mess around with installing
