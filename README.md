# Awesome Window Manager Configuration

This repository is a subdirectory of my larger [dotfiles](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles) repo, which houses my configurations and scripts that are useful to my in administering and customizing my Linux Installations.

## TL;DR
Basically this whole effort of fighting the Lua Demon, often loosing or seemingly loosing, is because the commonly known 
and impressive awesomewm configs actually suck in some way too great for me to ignore. They are either well organized but
awful to work with because few of us think 'oh tacos must mean configuring widgets, duh' and others really have had enough
Legend of Zelda to last the rest of our lives bound in Samsara and REALLY don't want to see dynamic variants of Link 
veneration at different hours of the day. There is nothing glorious here and I tried to prevent it from being too awful ;] 
TBH this is just an awesome pile of crap but it will serve as a better platform for your config...maybe. 


Kinds of Things I have done with bits from other configs

- Taken the best window decorations I have ever seen and compelled them to reasonably affect the window at least in my line of thinking
    - for example the Down Arrow meant float and the up arrow meant minimize?! I made the down the minimize and the floating point left
